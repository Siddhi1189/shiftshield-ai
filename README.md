## 📌 Problem Statement

India's **20 million+ gig delivery workers** (Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, etc.) lose **20–30% of their weekly income** due to external disruptions they cannot control:

| Disruption | Impact |
|---|---|
| 🌧️ Heavy rain / floods | Orders drop, roads blocked |
| 🌫️ AQI spikes (pollution) | Health risk, forced stoppage |
| 🚦 Traffic restrictions | Delivery time increases, earnings fall |

There is currently **no real-time financial safety net** for these workers. ShiftShield AI fixes that.

---

## 💡 Solution

ShiftShield AI is a **full-stack AI platform** that combines:

- 🔍 **Real-time environmental risk analysis** (rainfall + AQI → risk score)
- 💸 **Earnings impact simulation** (stay vs. relocate earnings)
- 🛡️ **Parametric insurance** (auto-triggered payouts, no claim form needed)
- 🗺️ **Shift optimization** (AI-recommended strategy to maximize income)
- 📊 **Admin analytics** (claims trends, fraud detection, risk distribution)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Select City → Adjust Conditions → Run AI Analysis
     ↓
Risk Score → Earnings Impact → Insurance Pricing
     ↓
AI Decision → Shift Strategy → Auto-Claim (if triggered)
```

1. Worker selects their **city** (pre-filled with real-world conditions)
2. AI calculates a **weighted risk score** from rainfall & AQI
3. **Earnings impact** is simulated (stay vs. relocate)
4. **Dynamic insurance premium & coverage** is priced to risk
5. **AI decision engine** recommends the best action
6. If thresholds are crossed → **claim auto-activated**, payout credited
7. All events logged in the **Admin Panel** for fraud monitoring

## 🏙️ Supported Cities

12 major Indian cities with pre-set peak-season conditions:

| City | Typical Risk | Key Condition |
|------|:---:|---|
| 🌫️ Delhi | Medium–High | Winter smog (AQI 350+) |
| ⛈️ Kolkata | Medium–High | Monsoon rain (130mm+) |
| ⛈️ Kochi | Medium | SW monsoon (150mm+) |
| 🌧️ Mumbai | Medium | Monsoon rain (110mm+) |
| 🌧️ Chennai | Medium | NE monsoon (95mm+) |
| 🌫️ Ahmedabad | Medium | Industrial AQI (260+) |
| 🌫️ Jaipur | Medium | Dust haze (AQI 275+) |
| 🌫️ Lucknow | Medium | Fog season (AQI 290+) |
| 🌦️ Surat | Medium | Rain + AQI combo |
| 🌤️ Hyderabad | Low | Mild conditions |
| 🌦️ Bengaluru | Low | Pleasant weather |
| 🌦️ Pune | Low | Moderate conditions |

---

## 📊 Parametric Trigger Thresholds

Claims are triggered **automatically** when:

| Parameter | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 🌧️ Rainfall | > 80 mm | Auto-claim activated |
| 🌫️ AQI | > 250 | Auto-claim activated |
| Both triggered | Both crossed | Payout guaranteed, risk floor = 55% |

---

## 💰 Dynamic Pricing Model

Premiums are calculated in real-time based on risk score — not fixed brackets:

```
Premium  = BASE_PREMIUM × (1 + risk_multiplier × VOLATILITY_FACTOR)
Coverage = Premium × COVERAGE_MULTIPLIER
```

| Risk Level | Score Range | Example Premium | Example Coverage |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 🟢 Low | 0–29% | ₹10/week | ₹250 |
| 🟡 Medium | 30–69% | ₹14–18/week | ₹350–₹450 |
| 🔴 High | 70–100% | ₹20–22/week | ₹500–₹550 |
